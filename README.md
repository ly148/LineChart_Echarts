Final Project for DATASTORIES IN JAVASCRIPT 2016 
<Liyuan Yin>
In this final project, I used fake datas to create an interactive line chart via Echarts, which 
is an opensource developed by Baidu team. It has different models for different types of chart, 
such as bar chart, map, line chart, radar, stack and so on. Based on the simple model, I customized
my own chart, which is annotated in the html file.
